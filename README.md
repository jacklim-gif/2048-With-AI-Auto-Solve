# 2048 AI Auto-Solver ✨

**The intelligent, autonomous game engine that beats 2048 while you watch.**

A beautiful, modern, and completely open-source implementation of the classic 2048 game. Unlike standard clones, this version comes with a built-in super-intelligent Agent that uses game theory to predict moves, optimize board space, and reach the 2048 tile autonomously.

It turns a simple puzzle into a fascinating showcase of AI—wrapped in a sleek Glassmorphism interface that looks incredible on any device.

## Features

* **Auto-Solver Mode** — Watch the AI instantly take over and clear the board using the Expectimax algorithm.
* **Glassmorphism UI + Animations** — Smooth tile sliding, blur effects, and glowing highlights for a premium feel.
* **Fast-Win Demo Mode** — Spawns larger tiles (2, 4, 8, 16, 32) so you can reach the 2048 tile in seconds for recording videos.
* **Survival Intelligence** — When the board gets crowded, the AI automatically deepens its search (from 4 steps to 6 steps) to find an escape route.
* **Fully Responsive** — Perfect scaling on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* **Zero Backend Needed** — 100% front-end technology. Runs directly in your browser.

## Tech Stack

* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **HTML5 Canvas & DOM Manipulation**
